<!-- Inline elements begin right after the previous element, where as the block element begin with a line break and end with a line break and take as much width as possible and take height as needed.some block elements are paragraph (p) and heading (h) tag and inline elements are link(a) and the img tag.
If an inline element appears between two blocking elements then the new lines are part of the block elements rather than the inline element.for eg: if a link appears between a pragraph and heading it seems as though it is a blocking element but rather the line breaks are part of the heading and pargraph tags.
